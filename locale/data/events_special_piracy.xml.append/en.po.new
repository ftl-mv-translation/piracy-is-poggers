"Did you know that in the base Multiverse game you could buy Shell Radiants from slavers?\n"
"    \n"
"And that mercenaries can give you 2 fleet delay + a sector map for less than 30 scrap?\n"
"\n"
"And that smugglers could sell you external Stealth Weapons and Reconstructive Teleporter?\n"
"\n"
"However, you needed to have 3 points of reputation with that faction before unlocking those offers, which pretty much no one ever does. This add-on is an attempt to encourage players to make use of pirates more.\n"
"\n"
"Some components of pirate events have been changed, including:\n"
"1. Offers that used to require 3 reputation now only require 2.\n"
"2. Purchasing normal services from pirates no longer increases general notoriety.\n"
"3. Generic friendly pirate events now have a 50% chance to show up when generic piracy events are called, with pirate threat events reduced to 25% and hostile pirate events reduced to 25%. (Each event used to have a 33% chance of appearing in base Multiverse)\n"
"4. Pirate Faction Reputation is now the sum of Pirate Reputation and Faction Reputation (it used to be one or the other), so having 1 pirate reputation and 1 smuggler reputation will grant you access to 2 smuggler reputation offers.\n"
"5. Most of the standard sectors now have increased chances to find a generic piracy event.\n"
"\n"
"Each pirate faction has a very special offer awaiting if you can accumulate 3-5 reputation :)\n"
"\n"
"As of 2.0.0, most pirate events in every sector have been updated to add/decrease reputation depending on your choices.\n"
"\n"
"You can also check your accumulated pirate reputation in the storage check box menu.\n"
"\n"
"If you want to see the amazing offers from each friendly pirate, you cannot have less than -1 reputation with that faction, otherwise you won't see the good offers regardless of how high your general pirate reputation is."

"The mercenary flips the folder open to a random page and shows you some profiles. \"Some of these people you see here are indebted to Vael or other high ranking Syndicate members, but they refuse to repay their debt for extended periods of time. Others have been causing trouble for the Syndicate, such as some of your Fed buddies. Anyways, this folder contains all of the people we'd like to target, our \"Naughty List\" if you will. Oh, come on, I know Christmas is over. Give me a break. Back to the point: All registered Syndicate mercenaries keep an updated record of these targets with them for our clients' use. See, one of the benefits of being a loyal customer is that you get to tell us who to take out! And the good thing is that we bring you some of the valuables that we can find on the target. So it's a win-win: You pay us some scrap to hunt someone down, the Syndicate removes a target off their list, and you reap some profits! We have detailed information regarding all these targets, including their wealth, so feel free to browse through all these profiles before making an \"appointment\", hehe...\"\n"
"\n"
"You glance inquiringly at the transmitter, and the mercenary continues: \"Now this transmitter here is how the Syndicate keeps its mercenaries informed of its up-to-date targets and allies. Another benefit of being a loyal customer is that we get to hand these out to you for 30 scrap each. With this in hand, you can call the nearest mercenary to perform a basic service for you anytime. Attacking targets is off the table for remote services however, since we can't risk this transmitter falling into the hands of some official. Imagine how awkward it would be if we sent our entire target list to Admiral Tully! Hah, I don't wanna think about it. Not sure if I'll get arrested or blown up by the Feds or Vael's elite mercenaries first. Oh yeah, you can only call us up to twice each sector. The Syndicate has a good amount of members, but our numbers are not infinite.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"And that's what we have for premium services. Of course, if you're uncomfortable doing this right now or if you're on a tight budget, our basic services are still discounted for loyal customers like you.\"\n"

"Anthony's first successful hack involved overriding the defense turret controls to fire upon the rebels who were harassing his community at the age of 15. In the past year his attacks on the Syndicate have caused large scrap losses stolen by him, but a week ago Anthony made a huge blunder and revealed his residency location while trying to hack the Syndicate again. Watchers have confirmed that Anthony is still residing in the same area, but more than one mercenary is required to take him down. While he can disable one mercenary's ship, swarming him with multiple will give enough time for a land operation, and Anthony has no known combat experience."

"Greg \"The Wolf\" Barnabas is the current leader of the smuggling ring named Tobias' Goods. He earned his nickname from his ruthlessness in business, combat, ship fights and leadership.\n"

"How He Started:\n"
"Greg \"The Wolf\" Barnabas seized leadership of a relatively unknown smuggling ring by defeating the former leader in hand-to-hand combat at the age of 20.\n"
"\n"
"How the Smuggling Ring expanded:\n"
"Around 15 years into his reign, rumours spread that Greg found some secret technology while almost being ready to roll out a superior smuggling method that lowered their risk of getting caught by officials massively. A combination of these two factors led to a boom in demand for Tobias' Goods' services.\n"
"\n"
"Today:\n"
"12 years later, Tobias' Goods' is set to overtake Argeonn as the most used smuggling service. Greg remains unchallenged for the position of leadership and resides in a special underground cavern built at his request 5 years ago."

"About:\n"
"Hunter Briggs, brother of the more well-known Federation officer Captain Briggs, is the lead Federation scientist in the fields of supernatural and extra-ordinary technology research.\n"
"\n"
"How He Started:\n"
"Hunter Briggs joined the Federation at the age of 25 and quickly established himself as one of the best scientists and researchers in the galaxy. \n"
"\n"
"How he got moved to his current research field:\n"
"8 years ago, Hunter was appointed to be the lead Federatiom scientist in the fields of supernatural and extra-ordinary technology research.  3 years ago, Hunter \"retired\" from daylight Federation operations and ,according to insider information, is now situated in an underground facility disguised by a fake Tony's store above it. Tony Sr. was paid to turn a blind eye to the fake store, and Hunter has been there since his \"retirement\".\n"
"\n"
"Today:\n"
"Based on insider information, Hunter has been digging up technology that even outclasses the elusive \"Aether tech\" that certain factions have been researching about. What concerns the Syndicate the most, however, is his efforts in developing a reverse-engineered computer virus, originally found in a wrecked ruin bearing traces of \"Aether\". If his development is successful, the Federation can rapidly deploy the virus into the systems of pirates, rebels, and any other faction that displeases them, ensuring the Federation's dominant control over piracy and the Rebellion."
