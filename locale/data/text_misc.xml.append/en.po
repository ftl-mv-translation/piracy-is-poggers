"This add-on expands on the existing pirate reputation system present in base Multiverse. Features include:\n"
"- Many events from base MV now provide the opportunity to gain/lose reputation.\n"
"- Increased chances to meet friendly pirates to check out their wares.\n"
"- Massive buffs to the stuff you can get from friendly slavers, mercenaries and smugglers. While base MV allowed these pirates to sell some normally unobtainable stuff, in this add-on they have even more normally unobtainable stuff and it's easier to get the required reputation now.\n"
"\n"
"Some of the cool stuff you can get include but are not limited to:\n"
"- Utility Bot Dispersal (that OP augment on Harmony Cruiser)\n"
"- Angel Crew\n"
"- Rift Waker 0.5 Power Efficient version\n"
"- Secret Technology?\n"
