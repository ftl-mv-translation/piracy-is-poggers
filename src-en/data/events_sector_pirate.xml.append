			<text>Enter the station.</text>

				<text>You're amazed to see that the station, which was formerly a shopping complex, has been refurbished into a large arena at the centre of the complex! Chatter with a friendly pirate reveals that Tiiikaka hosts these gladiator matches with their slaves as the gladiators. A large crowd of pirates have gathered to observe the games. The slavers have the fighters on display in their cages at the first floor. You also notice a booth at the second floor of the complex, a gambling area to place your bets, if you had to guess.</text>

					<text>Stick around and watch a few games.</text>
					<event>
						<text>The fights are more entertaining that you would've thought. It seems that the slaves, having fought each other so many times now, are capable of putting on quite a show, even if it's obvious they aren't fighting for their lives. Slavers might be scum, but they aren't going to let the slaves kill each other and lose their prime attraction. While your crew rushes off to buy some alien popcorn, you manage to witness a huge comeback as a lowly Zoltan disarms a Suzerain! You even befriend a pirate sitting next to you when both of you nearly lost it from that comeback. Though the fleet will likely have gained on you, the experience was awesome, and the pirate even offers to join your crew! They also bring along some of their scrap winnings from successfully betting on the fights.</text>

My men highly suspect that you provided illegal stimulants to the slave you bet on, and it doesn't look good when a slave that nobody expects to win gets their first win on a day when some Federation captain decides to bet on them. I understand that you're decently well-known around these parts, and it would be a shame for it to end this way. So, I'll allow you to walk away with a very small portion of the winnings if you'll forfeit the remainder to us." Before you can consider making your reply, you notice the other enforcers slowly reaching for their guns, and a vibration in your pocket signals that the AI on your ship is ready to cover you if you want to run.
