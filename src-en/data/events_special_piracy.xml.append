  <event name="PIRACY_INTRO">
    <text>Did you know that in the base Multiverse game you could buy Shell Radiants from slavers?
    
And that mercenaries can give you 2 fleet delay + a sector map for less than 30 scrap?

And that smugglers could sell you external Stealth Weapons and Reconstructive Teleporter?

However, you needed to have 3 points of reputation with that faction before unlocking those offers, which pretty much no one ever does. This add-on is an attempt to encourage players to make use of pirates more.

Some components of pirate events have been changed, including:
1. Offers that used to require 3 reputation now only require 2.
2. Purchasing normal services from pirates no longer increases general notoriety.
3. Generic friendly pirate events now have a 50% chance to show up when generic piracy events are called, with pirate threat events reduced to 25% and hostile pirate events reduced to 25%. (Each event used to have a 33% chance of appearing in base Multiverse)
4. Pirate Faction Reputation is now the sum of Pirate Reputation and Faction Reputation (it used to be one or the other), so having 1 pirate reputation and 1 smuggler reputation will grant you access to 2 smuggler reputation offers.
5. Most of the standard sectors now have increased chances to find a generic piracy event.

Each pirate faction has a very special offer awaiting if you can accumulate 3-5 reputation :)

As of 2.0.0, most pirate events in every sector have been updated to add/decrease reputation depending on your choices.

You can also check your accumulated pirate reputation in the storage check box menu.

If you want to see the amazing offers from each friendly pirate, you cannot have less than -1 reputation with that faction, otherwise you won't see the good offers regardless of how high your general pirate reputation is.</text>

      <event>
        <text>"Well it's good to see a loyal Syndicate customer! Come on board and I'll show you what we got."

Once you find yourself seated opposite to the mercenary captain, he pull out a dusty folder and a special transmitter. Before he explains the goods in front of him, he cautions you: "A word of warning, what I'm about to share with you is highly illegal and immoral. Though your superiors might have turned a blind eye to your use of our basic services, I doubt your reputation will remain clean if you make use of our premium services. Now, without further delay, let's get cracking."

(Purchasing a premium service will result in a notoriety increase, potentially a double notoriety increase for specific targets)</text>
        <choice req="loc_merc_premium" lvl="0" max_lvl="0" blue="false" max_group="0">
          <text>Continue...</text>
          <event name="MERCENARY_PREMIUM_INTRO_FIRST">
            <text>The mercenary flips the folder open to a random page and shows you some profiles. "Some of these people you see here are indebted to Vael or other high ranking Syndicate members, but they refuse to repay their debt for extended periods of time. Others have been causing trouble for the Syndicate, such as some of your Fed buddies. Anyways, this folder contains all of the people we'd like to target, our "Naughty List" if you will. Oh, come on, I know Christmas is over. Give me a break. Back to the point: All registered Syndicate mercenaries keep an updated record of these targets with them for our clients' use. See, one of the benefits of being a loyal customer is that you get to tell us who to take out! And the good thing is that we bring you some of the valuables that we can find on the target. So it's a win-win: You pay us some scrap to hunt someone down, the Syndicate removes a target off their list, and you reap some profits! We have detailed information regarding all these targets, including their wealth, so feel free to browse through all these profiles before making an "appointment", hehe..."

You glance inquiringly at the transmitter, and the mercenary continues: "Now this transmitter here is how the Syndicate keeps its mercenaries informed of its up-to-date targets and allies. Another benefit of being a loyal customer is that we get to hand these out to you for 30 scrap each. With this in hand, you can call the nearest mercenary to perform a basic service for you anytime. Attacking targets is off the table for remote services however, since we can't risk this transmitter falling into the hands of some official. Imagine how awkward it would be if we sent our entire target list to Admiral Tully! Hah, I don't wanna think about it. Not sure if I'll get arrested or blown up by the Feds or Vael's elite mercenaries first. Oh yeah, you can only call us up to twice each sector. The Syndicate has a good amount of members, but our numbers are not infinite."

"And that's what we have for premium services. Of course, if you're uncomfortable doing this right now or if you're on a tight budget, our basic services are still discounted for loyal customers like you."

NOTE from PIP Dev: Mercenary Targets will be reworked in 3.0.0 as the current concept of hunting targets is flawed. An improved version that makes more sense will replace the existing mercenary target system in 3.0.0 (Transmitter is here to stay though)</text>

NOTE from PIP Dev: Mercenary Targets will be reworked in 3.0.0 as the current concept of hunting targets is flawed. An improved version that makes more sense will replace the existing mercenary target system in 3.0.0 (Transmitter is here to stay though)</text>

      <event>
        <text>"Well it's good to see a loyal Syndicate customer! Come on board and I'll show you what we got."

Once you find yourself seated opposite to the mercenary captain, he pull out a dusty folder and a special transmitter. Before he explains the goods in front of him, he cautions you: "A word of warning, what I'm about to share with you is highly illegal and immoral. Though your superiors might have turned a blind eye to your use of our basic services, I doubt your reputation will remain clean if you make use of our premium services. Now, without further delay, let's get cracking."

(Purchasing a premium service will result in a notoriety increase, potentially a double notoriety increase for specific targets)</text>

          <text>Continue...</text>
          <event name="MERCENARY_PREMIUM_INTRO_FIRST">
            <text>The mercenary flips the folder open to a random page and shows you some profiles. "Some of these people you see here are indebted to Vael or other high ranking Syndicate members, but they refuse to repay their debt for extended periods of time. Others have been causing trouble for the Syndicate, such as some of your Fed buddies. Anyways, this folder contains all of the people we'd like to target, our "Naughty List" if you will. Oh, come on, I know Christmas is over. Give me a break. Back to the point: All registered Syndicate mercenaries keep an updated record of these targets with them for our clients' use. See, one of the benefits of being a loyal customer is that you get to tell us who to take out! And the good thing is that we bring you some of the valuables that we can find on the target. So it's a win-win: You pay us some scrap to hunt someone down, the Syndicate removes a target off their list, and you reap some profits! We have detailed information regarding all these targets, including their wealth, so feel free to browse through all these profiles before making an "appointment", hehe..."

You glance inquiringly at the transmitter, and the mercenary continues: "Now this transmitter here is how the Syndicate keeps its mercenaries informed of its up-to-date targets and allies. Another benefit of being a loyal customer is that we get to hand these out to you for 30 scrap each. With this in hand, you can call the nearest mercenary to perform a basic service for you anytime. Attacking targets is off the table for remote services however, since we can't risk this transmitter falling into the hands of some official. Imagine how awkward it would be if we sent our entire target list to Admiral Tully! Hah, I don't wanna think about it. Not sure if I'll get arrested or blown up by the Feds or Vael's elite mercenaries first. Oh yeah, you can only call us up to twice each sector. The Syndicate has a good amount of members, but our numbers are not infinite."

"And that's what we have for premium services. Of course, if you're uncomfortable doing this right now or if you're on a tight budget, our basic services are still discounted for loyal customers like you."</text>

I doubt most of his offerings will interest you, but he has a knack for dismantling unwanted tech from ships. If you've got something that you'd like to be removed from your ship, he's the man to call."

During my more active days of smuggling I've come to resent the restrictiveness of certain ship modifications. I remember this one time that a ship I was on took countless hits from some Rebels because the damn rock plating was weighing us down! I was determined to find out a way to strip the useless plating from the ship. So I spent a few months researching and discussing with other associates, until I finally managed to free the ship from the plating. Fast forward a couple of years, and I've come to specialise in this business. When someone wants to get rid of something tough, some deep-welded modification that can't simply be sold, they come to me. So that's the type of tech that I'm looking for. Because I'm seeking a challenge. Also because my collection of these items is magnificent!"</text>

Tommy was once a Syndicate member who held a modest rank among the mercenaries, earning his nickname from valiantly (or stupidly) retrieving a piece of cargo in a gunfight and getting hit by a ricochet shot in his left eye. After being paid a handsome amount for a big job, he took the profits and ran with his ship, never to be seen for years. Fortunately, the only major loss was the ship itself, which Thomas sold to finance a cheap retirement. While his cheap retirement means it will be easy to find him and take him out, he likely doesn't have anything valuable left.</text>

Brett hired some mercenaries to carry out some "activities" for his business, claiming he could pay them back three-fold of their normal rates once he got set up. His business didn't last long, and none of the mercenaries got paid. Brett still holds some profits from the business which he partially used on ship upgrades, his only defense against the Syndicate. He likely still has some profits kept in his abandoned warehouse, or maybe onboard his ship.

Gonk changed his name at the start of his mercenary career, or rather bounty hunting career. He's nearly as good as some of Vael's Angels, which says something for this relatively unknown character. The Syndicate would gladly have offered him a position, except for the fact that he pissed off one of Vael's friends by ruining a drug deal while he was on a job from the Federation. Gonk's decent skills should mean that he gets paid decently, and his characteristic ego shows in his lack of strong defenses. Still, he isn't a free kill, but should be no problem for a planned operation.

Mark is a normal father of two, and is about as normal of a human as he can be.

PROFIT POTENTIAL: Very High

Famously dubbed "Iron Fist" for beating information out of pirates with a smelted iron fist on a stick, Commander Wilson served his entire life in the Federation, enforcing the law on any pirates foolish enough to be near his base. His strong Federation presence meant that he was a tough target for a while, but now that he's retired he should be more vulnerable. Wilson will likely have a strong defense awaiting anyone attempting to exact revenge on him, but he likely has a good stash of possessions for being an influential Federation officer for 30 years.

Note: Wilson is one of the Federation's poster boys. Should anyone associated with the Federation attempt to murder him, the Federation will definitely be highly unpleased.

    <text>FULL NAME: Anthony Stone
ALIAS: Dangerous Hacker
AGE: 26
RACE: Human
PRIORITY: High
DIFFICULTY OF SUCCESSFUL OPERATION: High
PROFIT POTENTIAL: Very High

Anthony's first successful hack involved overriding the defense turret controls to fire upon the rebels who were harassing his community at the age of 15. In the past year his attacks on the Syndicate have caused large scrap losses stolen by him, but a week ago Anthony made a huge blunder and revealed his residency location while trying to hack the Syndicate again. Watchers have confirmed that Anthony is still residing in the same area, but more than one mercenary is required to take him down. While he can disable one mercenary's ship, swarming him with multiple will give enough time for a land operation, and Anthony has no known combat experience.

ALIAS: The Wolf

DIFFICULTY OF SUCCESSFUL OPERATION: Very High
PROFIT POTENTIAL: ???
    
About:
Greg "The Wolf" Barnabas is the current leader of the smuggling ring named Tobias' Goods. He earned his nickname from his ruthlessness in business, combat, ship fights and leadership.

How He Started:
Greg "The Wolf" Barnabas seized leadership of a relatively unknown smuggling ring by defeating the former leader in hand-to-hand combat at the age of 20.

How the Smuggling Ring expanded:
Around 15 years into his reign, rumours spread that Greg found some secret technology while almost being ready to roll out a superior smuggling method that lowered their risk of getting caught by officials massively. A combination of these two factors led to a boom in demand for Tobias' Goods' services.

Today:
12 years later, Tobias' Goods' is set to overtake Argeonn as the most used smuggling service. Greg remains unchallenged for the position of leadership and resides in a special underground cavern built at his request 5 years ago.</text>

        <text>"Ah, you're interested in "The Wolf"? Well this ain't like any targets we've done for you previously, so listen up."

"Argeonn isn't exactly interested in letting some random smuggling ring overtake them in demand, so they've contacted us to assist in their takedown. The operation involves at least 20 ships each from Argeonn and Syndicate, so as expected the spoils are gonna be split amongst all those involved."

"Unfortunately, the operation isn't guaranteed to go as planned. While I'm gonna need a hefty down-payment from you now to gear up and get more friends to join, the operation may take longer than expected, or the operation may not go as well as planned, so you might need to fork up time or scrap later on if you want the full payout. Otherwise, we're gonna need to give you a smaller reward to compensate for our damage. Word is that the operation has a 50% chance of going exactly as planned, so maybe you can get lucky and get a full payout without additional costs. Still down to support the takedown?"

About:
Hunter Briggs, brother of the more well-known Federation officer Captain Briggs, is the lead Federation scientist in the fields of supernatural and extra-ordinary technology research.

How He Started:
Hunter Briggs joined the Federation at the age of 25 and quickly established himself as one of the best scientists and researchers in the galaxy. 

How he got moved to his current research field:
8 years ago, Hunter was appointed to be the lead Federatiom scientist in the fields of supernatural and extra-ordinary technology research.  3 years ago, Hunter "retired" from daylight Federation operations and ,according to insider information, is now situated in an underground facility disguised by a fake Tony's store above it. Tony Sr. was paid to turn a blind eye to the fake store, and Hunter has been there since his "retirement".

Today:
Based on insider information, Hunter has been digging up technology that even outclasses the elusive "Aether tech" that certain factions have been researching about. What concerns the Syndicate the most, however, is his efforts in developing a reverse-engineered computer virus, originally found in a wrecked ruin bearing traces of "Aether". If his development is successful, the Federation can rapidly deploy the virus into the systems of pirates, rebels, and any other faction that displeases them, ensuring the Federation's dominant control over piracy and the Rebellion.</text>

        <text>"Ah, you're interested in the Federation dude? Well this ain't like any targets we've done for you previously, so listen up."

"This virus of his is dangerous to piracy and rebels in general, so there's an entire secret project to take this guy down that involves pirates from all factions and even a few rebels. While the secrecy of the location is one of their main defenses, it's pretty much guaranteed that we'll be going up against a host of other defenses like never seen before given the importance of this guy."

"Unfortunately, the operation isn't guaranteed to go as planned. While I'm gonna need a hefty down-payment from you now to gear up and get more friends to join, the operation may take longer than expected, or the operation may not go as well as planned, so you might need to fork up time or scrap later on if you want the full payout.

Gonna list down every event that I made changes to for pirate rep for future me to keep track of if anyone asks

Basic:
All basic trades with slavers, mercenaries and smugglers from PIRACY_GENERIC_FRIENDLY only add reputation, they no longer add notoriety like they did in base MV

All pirate threat events in PIRACY_GENERIC_CHOICE have a blue option if you have 2 combined rep to avoid the fight and trade instead, but you don't get to access the special stores/premium services even if you have more than 3 rep, only the "event" deals are available.

Standard Shops:
STOREEVENT_PIRATE_REFUELING - Stealing the fuel if given the option to trade/steal will decrease pirate rep
STOREEVENT_PIRATE_SECURITY - Having 2 rep gives a blue option to see some special goods which is basically the same pool of stuff that a friendly smuggler shows you when you have 2 rep. Using level 3 hacking against them gives an augment from the smuggler's superior augment pool on top of the High Weapon reward, and decreases your smuggling reputation TWICE
STOREEVENT_PIRATE_AWKWARD - Attacking the station decreases pirate rep by 1.
New store event: STOREEVENT_PIRATE_SERVICES - Basically a normal pirate shop but you get to also see any of the generic friendly pirates for their goods. You can also access the premium services, but accessing the special stores means that the normal store is replaced.
STOREEVENT_PIRATE_SERVICES can be found in the following sectors and the related unique sectors (non-nebula beacon): Mining, Union, Orchid, Separatist, Outcast, Pirate, Mantis, Auto, Abandoned, Lanius, Unexplored Nebula, Leech

Multiverse Drop Point:
(REMOVED IN 2.1.0) DROPPOINT_SKETCHY_UPGRADES - Accepting the Engine upgrade will give 1 pirate reputation.
MV_DISTRESS_TRAPPED_MINER - Freeing the miners either through a successful 50/50 dice roll of option 1 or the beam blue options gives 1 pirate reputation.

Generic events in events.xml.append:
QUEST_MERCENARY_DELIVERY_START - Selling fuel increases smuggler rep by 1. If you reach the quest beacon and have 1 smuggler rep, the blue option guarantees the good outcome for transferring. If they don't scam you, your smuggler rep increases by 1.
SELL_MISSILES_STATION - Selling any amount of missiles increases smuggler rep by 1. Attacking the station reduces smuggler rep by 1.
PIRATE_STATION_CROPS - Using any of the fire/particle blue options to assault the colony increases pirate rep by 1.
DISTRESS_TRAPPED_MINER - Same deal as the drop point variant above.
DISTRESS_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_BEACON and PIRATE_CIVILIAN - Complete overhaul of these two events. Now randomly selects between a slaver, mercenary or smuggler ship attacking the civilians. Defending the civilians reduces the corresponding faction rep by 1. Helping the pirates leads to fighting the civilians, who escape in 20 seconds. Depending on the type of pirate that was attacking, HK/CK/surrendering will give different outcomes. On the good outcome, you get stuff and a reputation increase for that faction.

newEvents.xml.append:
PIRATE_SALESMAN - Attacking immediately without hailing decreases smuggler rep by 1. Using Hacking or Targeting Jammer to lock their weapons decreases smuggler rep by 1. Added a 2+ combined smuggler rep option called "Request to dock safely", which grants access to a wider variety of offers, as well as removing the combat + damage if you don't buy anything.
Above event also has a new sub-event called DOCK_WEAPON_SALESMAN, so meeting this dude results in either a drone smuggler or a weapon smuggler.

Abandoned Sector:
ABANDONED_SLAVER_MOON - Slaves are pulled from the lists in autoBlueprints, not the oddshop slaves list. Also gives reputation for purchasing slaves and reduces reputation for attacking them.
QUEST_ABANDONED_RAID - Contacting the pirates and telling them that the colony is free will give 1 pirate rep, scrapping the colony for yourself reduces 1 pirate rep.

Union Coreworlds:
QUEST_GATLING_AUGMENT - Buying the Proto Pre-Igniter increases smuggler rep by 1 (either deal works), attacking for the augment reduces smuggler rep by 1.

Pirate Sector:
GUARD_PIRATE - Added a 1+ rep option that grants entry, low scrap and a quest marker for a random friendly pirate.
PIRATE_BRIBER - Added an ignore option that increases pirate rep by 1 without a fight or accepting the bribe.

Black Market:
GUARD_BLACKMARKET - Added a 2+ rep option for pirates and smugglers, 3+ rep option for slavers and mercenaries. Pirate option grants bunch of resources and high scrap, smuggler option grants low standard and opens a massive store, slaver and mercenary optionse each grant medium standard + quest marker to their respective friendly encounters.
ZOLTAN_LECTURE_MARKET - Siding with Zoltans reduces pirate rep by 1, successfully defeating the pirates decreases Zoltan notoriety by 1. Vice versa for siding with pirates.
QUEST_SMUGGLER_RAID - Successfully bringing the cargo back to the smuggler raises pirate rep and smuggler rep each by 1.

I added both of the above events into generic pirate sectors for the time being, will probably remove at least one of them once I add that new quest event for generic pirate sectors.

Coalition Sector:
DISTRESS_COALITION_PIRATE_FEAR - Giving the pirates supplies increases pirate rep by 1.

Duskbringer Sector:
DUSK_SLAVER_TRADE - Attacking the slavers reduces slaver rep by 1, buying a slave increases slaver rep by 1.
DUSK_PIRATES_HIDING - Normal Contact without a blue option: If given the choice of trading or attacking, attacking will decrease pirate rep by 1. Added a blue option that requires 1 pirate reputation and allows the player to either trade or fight a New Order ship with ASB support. Defeating the New Order ship gives 1 pirate rep.
DISTRESS_DUSK_MONASTERY - Helping the Duskbringers reduces pirate rep by 1. Helping the pirates and successfully defeating the Duskbringer ship increases pirate rep by 1.

Duskbringer Stronghold:
DEVORAK_FINALE - Luring Devorak out and leaving increases mercenary rep by 1. Fighting back against Jack decreases mercenary rep by 1.

Engi Harmony:
TURZIL_PIRATE_TRANSPORT - Having 3+ combined smuggler rep grants a blue option to talk peacefully to the smugglers to get Turzil for free without a fight.

Dynasty Sector:
NEBULA_DYNASTY_SMUGGLER - Fighting the smugglers or selling their location decreases smuggler rep by 1. Bribing the checkpoint or defeating the checkpoint increases smuggler rep by 1. Added an empty option after checking out the checkpoint to avoid forcing a notoriety increase/decrease.

Hektar:
BILLY - Fighting Taurus decreases mercenary rep by 1.

Leech Sector:
LEECH_DELIGATE_CAMP - Purchasing a zoltan increases slaver rep by 1. Attacking the slavers or threatening them reduces slaver rep by 1.

Leech Capital:
TONY_HQ - Fighting Cancer decreases mercenary rep by 1.

Nebula:
NEBULA_SLUG_HUNTER - Successfully defeating the slug ship increases pirate rep by 1.
NEBULA_PIRATE_SMUGGLE - Attacking the ship decreases smuggler rep by 1. Added a 2 smuggler rep blue option that randomly selects the weapon, drone or augment event, each of them has the smuggler offering a basic and advanced item for trade. Purchasing anything increases smuggler rep by 1.
NEBULA_LIGHT_PIRATE_STATION - Attacking the station decreases pirate rep by 1.

Orchid:
ORCHID_SLAVES - Attacking the slavers reduces slaver rep by 1. Buying an orchid increases slaver rep by 1. 

Auto:
AUTO_PIRATE_CHOICE - Assisting the pirates increase pirate rep by 1. NOTE: I'm not really convinced this event deserves a rep gain, if an overall nerf is required then this will be one of the first to go

Rock:
ROCK_ASTEROID_COLONY - Apprehending the pirate raiders successfully reduces pirate rep by 1.

Outcast:
OUTCAST_VICTIM - Helping the Outcasts succesfully reduces slaver rep by 1. Helping the Slavers successfully increases slaver rep by 1.
OUTCAST_MAKESHIFT - Attacking the camp or using the level 1 teleporter blue option decreases slaver rep by 1. Central teleport and upgraded teleporter claim you go "undetected" so no rep decrease for them. Added a 2 slaver rep blue option to hail them and offer to trade, presenting options of a rock, outcast or SSLG crystal. Buying any of them increase slaver rep by 1.

Slug:
NEBULA_QUEST_SLUG_PIRATE_TRAP - Added a third option to help the pirate at the quest beacon. Successfully defeating the Slug ship gives a medium item reward and 1 pirate rep.

Royal Slug:
NEBULA_KNIGHT_SMUGGLER - All attack or cripple engines options decrease smuggler rep by 1, all purchase options increase smuggler rep by 1. Added a 1+ rep blue option that grants a 50% discount on the narcotics price and a 3+ rep blue option that gives you the narcotics for free and allows you to buy another bunch.

Infested:
INFESTATION_SLAVERS - Buying a slave increases slaver rep by 1, attacking them reduces slaver rep by 1.
INFESTATION_IRWIN - Intervening to save Irwin decreases mercenary rep by 1.

Zoltan:
ZOLTAN_FIGHTER_MONK - Purchasing the monk increases slaver rep by 1. Added a 2 slaver rep blue option where you can get the monk at a discount.
QUEST_ZOLTAN_LAWBOOK - Purchasing the lawbook increases smuggler rep by 1. Attacking them for it decreases smuggler rep by 1. Added a 2 smuggler rep blue option to get the lawbook for free but that doesn't increase rep again.

Ministry Capital:
DISTRESS_CAPITAL_ARREST - Turning the pirates in reduces one of the faction's reputation chosen at random. Victory results in the corresponding faction's rep increasing by 1. Smuggler store uses STORE_SMUGGLER_VERYBASIC instead of generic pirate store.
CAPITAL_SMUGGLER - Smuggler store uses STORE_SMUGGLER_VERYBASIC instead of generic pirate store.
